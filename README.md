Red Bull Air Race Interlaken track


For those who are looking for difficult challenges, here is another Red Bull Air Race track that took place in Switzerland in 2007.

To instal just unzip the files into your '\Documents\Aerofly FS 2\scenery\places\CH' folder.

In the attachment you will find a track diagram. Rules like in other such event: two times we travel the entire route, wings leveled in blue gates and knifed in red one.)

Switzerland DLC is required
